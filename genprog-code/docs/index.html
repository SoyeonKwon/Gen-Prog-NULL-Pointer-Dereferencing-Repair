<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>
  Software engineering is expensive, summing to over one half of one percent of
the US GDP annually. Software maintenance accounts for over two-thirds of that
life cycle cost, and a key aspect of maintenance is fixing bugs in existing
programs. Unfortunately, the number of reported bugs far outstrips available
development resources. It is common for a popular project to have hundreds of
new bug reports filed every day.
</p>
<p>
<b>Software maintenance is expensive.</b> GenProg reduces software maintenance
costs by automatically producing patches (repairs) for program defects.
</p>

<h2>Our Approach</h2>
<p>
Many bugs can be fixed with just a few changes to a program's source code. Human
repairs often involve inserting new code and deleting or moving existing
code. GenProg uses those same building blocks to search for repairs
automatically.
</p>
<p>
<b>GenProg uses <i>genetic programming</i> to search for repairs.</b> Our
evolutionary computation represents candidate repairs as sequences of edits to
software source code. Each candidate in a large population is applied to the
original program to produce a new program, which is evaluated using test
suites. Those candidates that pass more tests are said to have a higher fitness
and are iteratively subjected to computational analogs of the biological
processes of mutation and crossover. This process terminates when a candidate
repair is found that retains all required functionality and fixes the
bug. GenProg does not require special code annotations or formal specifications,
and applies to unmodified legacy software.
</p>

<h2>Our Results</h2>
<p>
GenProg has repaired many kinds of defects, including infinite loops,
segmentation violations, heap buffer overflows, non-overflow denial-of-service
vulnerabilities, stack buffer overflows, format string vulnerabilities, integer
overflows â€” as well as the ubiquitous "my program produces the incorrect output"
bug. While we evaluate primarily on C programs, GenProg can also repair programs
in other languages, such as x86 or ARM assembly files or ELF binaries.
</p>
<p>
<b>GenProg repaired 55 out of 105 bugs for $8 each</b> in a systematic study
that included multiple programs, totaling over 5 million lines of code, and
supported by over 10,000 test cases.

GenProg has won multiple academic <i>best paper awards</i> (ICSE 2009, GECCO
2009, SBST 2009). In addition, this work was awarded
the <a href="http://www.cs.uoregon.edu/events/icse2009/awards/">IIFIP TC2
Manfred Paul Award</a> "for excellence in software: theory and practice."
Finally, GenProg won gold (in 2009) and bronze (in 2012) honors at
the <a href="http://www.genetic-programming.org/hc2009/cfe2009.html">"Humies"
Awards</a> for human-competitive results produced by genetic and evolutionary
computation.
